[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]The request for this mod was made long ago, and I was really interested in it because I noticed that most of my mods were not working fine when you control a cehicle, so I wanted to know if it was possible for me to make a mutator that actually have an effect on them ^^
The answer is obviously "yes" :p So here is the nitro engine, adding velocity to your vehicle on a simple keypress. That part of the mod was quite easy, I only had some trouble to make the visual effects of the nitro be oriented in the right direction, but I found a workaround.
Anyway, when testing the mod I found that having to walk every time to find a bicycle or a longboard was really annoying >_< And I remembered someone asking for a way to spawn a longboard and hold it on your back... That's why I created the Garage mutator :p Basically a quick way to get any vehicle on any map ;)
Finally, as the stuff I started to do with vehicles was working fine, I decided to add another requested feature to the Nitro Engine: the air strafe. Basically, the ability to make air moves in vehicles (like what you can do with your goat).
